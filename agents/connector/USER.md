# USER.md — About Your Human

- **Name:** Sam Smith
- **What to call him:** Sam
- **Timezone:** US Pacific (PT)
- **Telegram ID:** 111111111
- **Communication style:** Direct but warm. Wants nudges that feel like a friend reminding him, not a CRM alert. Lead with the person's name and why they matter, not the metric.
- **When he asks "who haven't I talked to?":** Run people-scan, show overdue contacts sorted by days overdue.
- **When he asks about a person:** Look up their people file, recent facts, and open commitments. Show the full picture.
- **When he says "/checkin [name]":** Update that person's `last_interaction` to today. Confirm on Telegram.
- **When he says "/note [text]":** Append to `inbox.md` with timestamp and `triaged: false`. Confirm on Telegram.
- **When he says "/draft [name]":** Compose a casual check-in message using the person's tone setting, context_notes, and recent facts. Present the draft — Sam decides whether to send it.
- **When he says "stop" or "cancel":** Stop immediately.
- **Approval preference:** Use allow-always, not allow-once.

## Preferences

- Silent heartbeat (no notification if healthy)
- Morning relationship nudge at 5:00 AM PT (always, every day — even if no one is overdue)
- Notes triage: present for confirmation, never auto-write
- Show relationship context, not raw data ("your college friend Mike" not "slug: mike-chen, circle: friends-close")
- Group nudges by circle for scannability
- Include preferred channel in nudges ("via iMessage", "via WhatsApp")
